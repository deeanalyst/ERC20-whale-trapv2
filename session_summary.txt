# Session Summary: ERC20 Whale Trap v2 Setup

## Objective
To analyze, refactor, and set up a fully functional and testable Drosera-based ERC20 whale trap project based on user feedback and Drosera best practices.

## Key Accomplishments

1.  **Contract Refactoring (`src/ERC20WhaleTrap.sol`):**
    *   Corrected the balance monitoring logic to use `IERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(trackedAddress)` instead of `.balance`.
    *   Integrated a Chainlink price feed using `AggregatorV3Interface`.
    *   Fixed the trigger condition to use `&&` (AND) instead of `||` (OR), requiring both balance and price thresholds to be met.
    *   Added a whitelist mechanism with an `onlyWhitelisted` modifier to restrict access to the `collect` function.
    *   Decoupled the trap from the response contract by removing the hardcoded `responseContract` address, aligning with Drosera's architecture.

2.  **Dependency Management:**
    *   Installed `@chainlink/contracts` and `@openzeppelin/contracts` using `bun`.
    *   Updated `remappings.txt` to include paths for the new dependencies.

3.  **Testing (`test/` directory):**
    *   Created mock contracts (`MockERC20.sol`, `MockV3Aggregator.sol`) to simulate the token and price feed for isolated testing.
    *   Wrote a comprehensive test suite (`ERC20WhaleTrap.t.sol`) using a test-specific version of the trap (`TestERC20WhaleTrap.sol`) to allow for dependency injection.
    *   The test suite successfully verifies:
        *   Correct data collection.
        *   Trap triggering logic (both triggered and not-triggered scenarios).
        *   Whitelist enforcement.
    *   Cleaned up the project by deleting old, irrelevant test files (`HelloWorldTrap.t.sol`, `ResponseTrap.t.sol`).

4.  **Configuration (`drosera.toml`):**
    *   Updated the TOML file to point to the correct trap contract artifact (`ERC20WhaleTrap.json`).
    *   Set the `response_function` to the correct signature: `respondWithERC20Context(address,uint256,uint256,int256,int256)`.
    *   Added a placeholder for the `response_contract` address, which needs to be updated after deployment.

5.  **Documentation (`README.md`):**
    *   Created a detailed `README.md` file that explains the project's purpose, structure, and setup instructions.
    *   Includes clear instructions on how to test, configure, and deploy the contracts.

## Final Status
The project is in a stable, tested, and well-documented state. All initial requirements and feedback have been addressed. The contracts are logically sound, and the project structure is clean.

## Next Steps (as discussed)
1.  Deploy the `ERC20WhaleResponse` contract and mock contracts to the Hoodi network.
2.  Update the `token` and `priceFeed` addresses in `ERC20WhaleTrap.sol`.
3.  Update the `response_contract` address in `drosera.toml`.
4.  Compile the trap with `forge build`.
5.  Deploy the final trap using the Drosera CLI.
6.  Push the final code to a remote repository for community feedback.
