Hello! To get you back up to speed on our ERC20 Whale Trap project, please read the following two files:

1.  `query.txt`: This contains my original, detailed request.
2.  `session_summary.txt`: This file details everything we accomplished in our last session, including all the code changes, tests, and documentation we created.

After you have reviewed them, let me know you're ready and we can continue.
